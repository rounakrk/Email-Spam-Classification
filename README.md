# Email-Spam-Classification
Predicting whether the email is spam or ham using NLP and machine learning algorithms.

For running the following code one must have:
1. nltk library
2. stop words downloaded
3. and the data.csv file for the whole process

You can get the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/team-ai/spam-text-message-classification)

Here I am using text preprocessing and Porter Stemmer for text pre-processing.

And for model building I am using models like SVC, Random Forest and XGB classifier.

Hope you like it.
